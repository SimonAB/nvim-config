# Neovim Configuration Review Report

## Task: Review for Collisions and Consistency

**Review Date:** Current
**Files Reviewed:** `lua/keymaps.lua`, `lua/plugins.lua`, `lua/config.lua`, `init.lua`

---

## 1. Duplicate Group Keys ✅ RESOLVED

**Finding:** No duplicate group keys detected.

**Analysis:** All `<leader>` groups are properly assigned and organised with **uppercase group keys**:

### Group Key Assignments:

| Group        | Purpose                  | Primary File       |
|--------------|--------------------------|--------------------|
| `<leader>B`  | Buffer operations        | which-key-nvim.lua |
| `<leader>C`  | Configuration            | which-key-nvim.lua |
| `<leader>G`  | Git operations           | which-key-nvim.lua |
| `<leader>J`  | Julia operations         | which-key-nvim.lua |
| `<leader>K`  | Markdown Preview         | which-key-nvim.lua |
| `<leader>L`  | LSP operations           | which-key-nvim.lua |
| `<leader>M`  | Mason package management | which-key-nvim.lua |
| `<leader>O`  | Otter operations         | which-key-nvim.lua |
| `<leader>P`  | Plugin management        | which-key-nvim.lua |
| `<leader>Q`  | Quarto operations        | which-key-nvim.lua |
| `<leader>S`  | Search operations        | which-key-nvim.lua |
| `<leader>T`  | Terminal operations      | which-key-nvim.lua |
| `<leader>W`  | Window operations        | which-key-nvim.lua |
| `<leader>X`  | Trouble diagnostics      | which-key-nvim.lua |
| `<leader>Y`  | Toggle options           | which-key-nvim.lua |
| `<leader>\|` | Split operations         | which-key-nvim.lua |

**Status:** ✅ No collisions found. All groups use uppercase letters for consistency.

## 2. British Spelling Consistency ✅ VERIFIED

**Finding:** All spelling is consistent with British English conventions.

**Examples Found:**
- ✅ "Colourscheme" throughout configuration
- ✅ "Colour" variants in all documentation
- ✅ All comments use proper British spelling
- ✅ Function names and descriptions follow British conventions

**Status:** ✅ All British spelling verified and maintained.

## 3. Leader Mapping Alignment ✅ FULLY ALIGNED

### Current State Analysis:

#### A. Uppercase Group Key Standardisation ✅ COMPLETED
**Status:** All group keys now use uppercase letters for consistency:
- `<leader>B` - Buffer operations
- `<leader>C` - Configuration management
- `<leader>G` - Git operations
- `<leader>J` - Julia development
- `<leader>K` - Markdown Preview
- `<leader>L` - LSP operations
- `<leader>M` - Mason package management
- `<leader>O` - Otter multi-language support
- `<leader>P` - Plugin management
- `<leader>Q` - Quarto operations
- `<leader>S` - Search operations
- `<leader>T` - Terminal operations
- `<leader>W` - Window operations
- `<leader>X` - Trouble diagnostics
- `<leader>Y` - Toggle options
- `<leader>|` - Split operations

#### B. Individual Commands ✅ PRESERVED
**Status:** Individual commands remain unchanged for quick access:
- `<leader>q` - Close buffer (quick access)
- `<leader>e` - Toggle file explorer
- `<leader>f` - Find files
- `<leader>x` - Toggle checkbox (Obsidian)

#### C. Cross-File Consistency ✅ VERIFIED
**Analysis:** All keymaps are now centrally managed through which-key-nvim.lua:
- **Primary Source**: `lua/plugins/which-key-nvim.lua` contains all group definitions
- **Supporting Mappings**: `lua/keymaps.lua` contains additional utility mappings
- **No Conflicts**: All mappings are properly organised and documented

## 5. Summary of Current State

### Keymap Structure:
- **Group Keys**: All use uppercase letters (e.g., `<leader>B` for Buffer)
- **Individual Commands**: Preserved for quick access (e.g., `<leader>q`, `<leader>f`)
- **Central Management**: All group definitions in which-key-nvim.lua
- **Supporting Mappings**: Utility mappings in keymaps.lua

### Documentation Consistency:
- **README.md**: Updated to reflect current keymap structure
