# Modern Neovim Configuration

A modern, comprehensive Neovim configuration harmonised from LunarVim for Neovim 0.12+, using British conventions. Features vim.pack plugin management, Julia LSP integration, and extensive LaTeX support.

## üîÑ VimTeX + Skim Inverse Search Integration

One of the standout features of this configuration is the seamless integration between VimTeX, Skim PDF viewer, and Neovim for LaTeX document editing. This setup enables **inverse search**, a powerful workflow enhancement that bridges the gap between your LaTeX source code and the compiled PDF output.

### What is Inverse Search?

Inverse search (also known as backward search or SyncTeX) is a bidirectional navigation system that allows you to:

- **Forward Search**: Jump from a specific line in your LaTeX source code directly to the corresponding location in the PDF
- **Backward Search**: Click on any part of the PDF and immediately navigate to the exact line in your source code that generated that content

This creates a seamless editing experience where you can visualise your changes in real-time and quickly locate the source of any content you see in the rendered document.

### Why This Integration Matters

**Traditional LaTeX Workflow Problems:**
- Switching between editor and PDF viewer breaks concentration
- Finding the source of specific content in large documents is time-consuming
- Difficult to correlate compilation errors with source locations
- No visual feedback when editing complex mathematical expressions or figures

**Benefits of VimTeX + Skim + Neovim Integration:**

1. **Seamless Navigation**: Instantly jump between source and output with a single keypress or click
2. **Enhanced Productivity**: Spend more time writing and less time searching for content
3. **Real-time Feedback**: See how changes affect the final document without losing your place
4. **Error Debugging**: Quickly locate and fix LaTeX compilation errors
5. **Complex Document Management**: Effortlessly navigate large documents with multiple chapters and sections
6. **Visual Context**: Understand how your code translates to the final output, especially useful for tables, figures, and mathematical expressions

### How It Works in This Configuration

**VimTeX** provides the LaTeX editing capabilities within Neovim, including syntax highlighting, compilation, and SyncTeX support. **Skim** (macOS PDF viewer) offers excellent SyncTeX integration and fast rendering. **Neovim** serves as the central hub, coordinating between the editor and viewer.

Key features enabled in this setup:
- Automatic SyncTeX generation during compilation
- Forward search with `<leader>lv` (LaTeX view)
- Backward search by Cmd+clicking in Skim
- Real-time PDF updates on file save
- Warp terminal compatibility for enhanced workflow

### Terminal Integration

This configuration is specifically optimised for terminal-based workflows, including compatibility with Warp terminal. The inverse search functionality works seamlessly whether you're using Neovim in a terminal emulator or as a standalone application, making it perfect for developers who prefer command-line environments.

### Inverse Search Script Internals

The `skim_inverse_search.sh` script implements a robust three-tier approach to handle inverse search from Skim PDF viewer to Neovim:

#### Method 1: Headless VimtexInverseSearch Call

The preferred method using VimTeX's built-in inverse search functionality:

1. **Direct Command**: Executes `nvim --headless -c "VimtexInverseSearch $LINE '$FILE'"`
2. **VimTeX Integration**: Relies on VimTeX's internal inverse search mechanism
3. **Background Execution**: Runs in headless mode without creating a visible Neovim instance

This method provides native VimTeX functionality and works without requiring server setup, making it the most reliable primary option.

#### Method 2: Using nvr with Existing Server Socket

Fallback method when a Neovim server is already running:

1. **Prerequisite Check**: Verifies that `nvr` (Neovim Remote) is available at `/opt/homebrew/bin/nvr` and that a server socket exists at `/tmp/nvim_server`
2. **File Opening**: Uses `nvr --remote-silent` to open the target file in the existing Neovim instance
3. **Line Navigation**: Sends a `:LINE<CR>` command via `nvr --remote-send` to jump to the specified line
4. **Focus Management**: Uses AppleScript to bring Warp terminal to the foreground
5. **Success Exit**: Exits with status 0 if successful

This method provides fast performance and preserves existing editor state when an nvr server is available.

#### Method 3: Fallback to Opening New Neovim Instance via osascript

The final fallback method for when no Neovim instances are running:

1. **Process Check**: Uses `pgrep nvim` to detect any running Neovim processes
2. **Existing Instance**: If found, focuses Warp terminal assuming Neovim is running there
3. **New Instance**: If no instance found, uses AppleScript to:
   - Activate Warp terminal
   - Wait 0.5 seconds for terminal to become active
   - Send keystrokes to execute `nvim +$LINE "$FILE"`
   - Press Enter to execute the command

This method ensures inverse search works even from a cold start, though it's the slowest option.

#### Debug Logging Flow

Comprehensive logging is implemented throughout the script for troubleshooting:

- **Log Location**: All debug information is written to `/tmp/inverse_search.log`
- **Timestamp Format**: Each log entry includes `$(date)` for precise timing information
- **Method Tracking**: Logs which method is being attempted ("Trying VimtexInverseSearch", "Trying nvr", etc.)
- **Success/Failure States**: Records the outcome of each method attempt
- **Command Output**: Redirects both stdout and stderr from nvr and osascript commands to the log
- **Process State**: Logs whether existing Neovim instances were found

**Example log flow:**
```
Tue Jan 14 10:30:15 GMT 2025: Inverse search called with LINE=42, FILE=/path/to/document.tex
Tue Jan 14 10:30:15 GMT 2025: Trying VimtexInverseSearch
Tue Jan 14 10:30:15 GMT 2025: Trying nvr with existing server
Tue Jan 14 10:30:15 GMT 2025: Positioned cursor at line 42
Tue Jan 14 10:30:15 GMT 2025: nvr command completed
```

This logging system makes it easy to diagnose inverse search failures and understand which method successfully handled the request.

- **Telescope**: Use `<leader>Sk` to search through all keymaps
- **Help**: Use `:help` for Neovim documentation
- **LSP**: Use `K` for hover information, `gd` for go to definition
- **Configuration**: Use `<leader>Cs` to reload all configuration files
