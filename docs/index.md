## Quick Example

```vim
# Terminal Integration
<C-t>             # Toggle terminal
<Leader>Tt        # Smart terminal toggle (vertical)
<Leader>Th/Tv/Tf  # Horizontal/Vertical/Float terminal
<C-i>             # Send line to terminal
<C-c>             # Send code block to terminal

# Document Processing
\lv               # LaTeX forward search
\ll               # Compile LaTeX
<Leader>Kp        # Markdown preview
<Leader>Qp        # Quarto preview

# Julia Development
<Leader>Jrv       # Julia REPL (vertical)
<Leader>Jp        # Project status
<Leader>Ji        # Instantiate project
```

## Performance Metrics

- **Startup Time**: 88ms (16% improvement from 105ms)
- **Plugin Loading**: 63ms (20% improvement from 79ms)
- **Core Configuration**: 2ms (92% improvement from 26ms)

## Requirements

### Essential
- Neovim 0.12+ (required for vim.pack)
- Git
- Cargo (for blink.cmp compilation)
- ripgrep, fd (for Telescope)

### Document Processing
- **LaTeX**: MacTeX or BasicTeX, Skim PDF viewer (macOS)
- **Typst**: `brew install typst`
- **Markdown**: Node.js (for preview)

### Language Support
- **Julia**: 1.9+ with LanguageServer.jl
- **Python**: 3.8+ with pyright LSP
- **R**: 4.0+ with languageserver package

## Installation

```bash
# Clone configuration
git clone https://github.com/SimonAB/nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
cd ~/.config/nvim

# First launch - plugins install automatically
nvim

# Verify installation
nvim --startuptime /tmp/startup.log -c quit
```

See the [Installation Guide](/INSTALLATION_GUIDE) for complete setup instructions.

## Key Features

### Terminal Integration

Smart terminal with code block detection and execution:
- Toggle terminal with `<C-t>` or `<Leader>Tt`
- Send lines, blocks, or selections to terminal
- Multiple terminal layouts (horizontal, vertical, float)
- Julia REPL with `--threads=auto` for parallel computing

### Document Workflows

Complete LaTeX workflow with bidirectional SyncTeX:
- Forward search: Neovim â†’ PDF (`\lv`)
- Inverse search: PDF â†’ Neovim (Cmd+Shift+Click in Skim)
- Automatic compilation with latexmk
- Bibliography management

Quarto integration for reproducible research:
- Live preview with code execution
- Support for R, Python, Julia code blocks
- Render to PDF, HTML, or Word

### Theme Management

Beautiful theme system with live preview:
- `<Leader>Ytp` - Theme picker with Telescope
- `<Leader>Yc` - Cycle through themes
- Auto dark mode based on system preference
- Themes: Catppuccin, OneDark, Tokyo Night, Nord, GitHub

## Philosophy

This configuration prioritises:

1. **Performance**: Fast startup, efficient plugin loading
2. **Discoverability**: WhichKey integration for keymap discovery
3. **Consistency**: British spelling, logical keymap organisation
4. **Research Workflows**: Optimised for academic document preparation
5. **Maintainability**: Clean, documented code with modular architecture
