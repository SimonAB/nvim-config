## Special Characters

- `<LocalLeader>` - Show local leader commands
- `<C-` - Control key combinations
- `<A-` - Alt key combinations
- `<S-` - Shift key combinations

## Customization

### Adding Keymaps
Create `~/.config/nvim/lua/user.lua`:

```lua
-- Add your custom keymaps
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>mykey", ":MyCommand<CR>", {
    desc = "My custom command"
})
```

### Remapping Existing Keys
```lua
-- Remap existing keymap
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>f", ":MyCustomFinder<CR>", {
    desc = "Custom file finder"
})
```

## Keymap Discovery

### Which-Key Integration
- Press `<Space>` and wait to see all available commands
- Type part of a command to filter results
- Use `<BS>` to go back in the navigation tree

### Help Commands
```vim
:WhichKey        " Show all keymaps
:WhichKey <key>  " Show keymaps for specific key
:help which-key  " Which-Key documentation
```

## Troubleshooting

### Keymap Conflicts
1. Check for conflicting mappings: `:verbose map <key>`
2. Use `:WhichKey` to visualize conflicts
3. Override in `user.lua` if needed

### Slow Keymaps
1. Check for expensive operations in keymap functions
2. Use `vim.defer_fn()` for heavy operations
3. Consider lazy loading heavy plugins

### Missing Keymaps
1. Ensure plugin is loaded: `:lua require("plugins.plugin-name")`
2. Check plugin configuration
3. Verify keymap registration in plugin files

ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: Use Which-Key's discoverability features! Press `<Space>` and explore the command tree to learn available keymaps.
